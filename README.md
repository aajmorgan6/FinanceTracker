# Finance Tracker

Project working towards user's being able to track their spendings.

Utilizes Django REST framework on the backend, and React.js on the frontend.

Might connect to an email address that can be scanned periodically for emails of a certain subject (i.e. EXPENSE) and get the amount and reason data from the body.

## TODO: 

Start getting previous week's worth of expenses and display them on a chart/graph.

Make users so that multiple people can use this.

More fields:
- Input own date, but have default be now
- Set up subscriptions, reoccuring payments

Show this week's total off the bat

Different pages, i.e. all expenses, planning
